Sun Yat Sen University is one of six Chinese labs to be kicked off the list since December amid a Trump administration and NIH housecleaning.  The latest to go is China Medical University, axed from the list sometime in the past week.  CMU had become a target for President Trump’s @DOGE, which prodded @NIH in February to cancel a $135,000 grant that included infecting rabbits with malaria.  Chinese labs have been under scrutiny since the coronavirus outbreak, which many U.S. agencies say leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab that received U.S. taxpayer money for some of its animal research.  The White Coat Waste Project, a watchdog group, has been tracking NIH’s efforts and hailed the attempt to clean up its list of labs.  “After [Dr. Anthony] Fauci’s gain-of-function disaster in Wuhan that we first exposed — and President Trump quickly defunded in April 2020—no animal labs in China should receive another red cent of taxpayers’ money,” said Anthony Bellotti, White Coat’s president.  White Coat, which opposes taxpayer money going to animal testing, said the Chinese labs “abuse dogs, bunnies, primates and other animals in cruel, dangerous and wasteful experiments.”  NIH’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare maintains a list of labs, domestic and foreign, that are approved for animal testing using American taxpayer money. They are labs that have obtained certification by the Public Health Service that they comply with certain standards for care of the animals they use — and their treatment at the end of the experiments.  The domestic list dropped from 1,108 approved labs in mid-December to 1,097 now.  The number of foreign labs went from 348 to 336 — meaning the six Chinese labs accounted for half of the total decline.  Twenty-one Chinese labs still remain on the list. NIH has not said why it booted the labs, nor why others still remain.  The agency did not provide a comment to The Washington Times for this story.  @RepLisaMcClain, Michigan Republican, has written legislation that would bar U.S. money going to labs in countries that are adversaries of the U.S., including Russia, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and China.  As of now, only China still has active labs approved.  “My bipartisan AFAR Act would ensure that failures like those of the Wuhan Lab will never happen again,” the congresswoman told The Washington Times. “I’m looking forward to introducing it this Congress. American tax dollars should never fund dangerous, cruel experiments on animals in research labs in China and other adversarial countries.”  @SenJoniErnst, who sponsors a Senate version of the bill, cheered the Trump administration for acting.  “I have been calling to end these batty studies for years and am thrilled to see the Trump administration cutting off the funding for risky research that never should have been funded in the first place,” the Iowa Republican said. “It makes zero sense for America to borrow billions from China and then turn around and send the money right back.”  The Washington Times reported last year that Sun Yat Sen University carried out grisly experiments on beagles.  Video compiled by the White Coat Waste Project showed dogs whose spines had been severed crawling on their front paws with their rears dragging on the ground. And puppies as young as a day old were being “sacrificed” to obtain bone marrow, WCW said.  The experiments were intended to study the effects of severe spinal-cord injuries. While the U.S. government funds the labs, WCW said there was no evidence that taxpayer money went specifically to those beagle experiments.  But Pharmaron TSP, which is still on the approved list, does spend American money on dog experiments, according to WCW’s investigations.  One of the labs that has been dropped from the list in recent months is the Shenzen Institutes of Advanced Technology, which is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The U.S. government has linked the academy to the Chinese military.  Also dropped from the list since December were Motac Beijing Services, Nanjing Medical University and Medicilon Preclinical Research, which used American money to perform drug-safety tests on rats."

CARE is instilling in our society the fact that 'disasters exist for animals too' during the 2005 Yangyang forest fire and is carrying out disaster relief activities..  In the past, almost everyone didn't release animals tied to a line, compared to the size of the forest fire, and compared to the amount of animal damage was low, this time forest fire allowed a lot of animals to escape despite a large area being engulfed in fire, this is because caretakers let them loose the line. Generally, many people loosen up so the animals could escape by themselves.  However, they still haven't loosen the ropes, and even though there was a fire in the nearby area several days ago and evacuations were triggered, animals who were burned by the fire without evacuating the animals in advance or at least loosen the line.  Citizens who don't let loose their line still exist because there are no separate shelters that accept animals in case of disasters and they think that if they are unleashed they could be lost..  Once again, the lack of safety among citizens is becoming a factor in animal harm. Despite reports that the forest fire that occurred 2-3 days ago in the nearby area is spreading, there are cases that preventable damage can be caused by not evacuating animals.  In addition to Care, many animal organizations are participating in the relief efforts during this forest fire..  Even though it is possible to prevent first-rate damage by loosening the line in situations where these things are not prepared at all, many problems that may arise afterwards (traffic accidents, losses, animal fights and bites etc.) are inevitable and will be faced with another problem.  Unfortunately, there is no solution to the problems of wildlife and livestock, but it is easy to find solutions as pets and civic groups can step up and work together.  The animal damage in the nearby areas, which started with the current Uiseong forest fires, is mostly preventable in advance.  In some states in the U.S. it is legal to not leave animals alone on the floor in case of a disaster or crisis. In case of a disaster in Korea, there should be an animal protection law that does not leave animals alone on the floor, and CARE will soon begin a legislative campaign.  CARE will continue to be at the scene of the wildfire disaster. For two days this week, Saturday and Sunday, we will recruit a citizen's search team to search for the remaining damaged animals""  ✉️Apply at care@careanimalrights.or.kr  Full post ➡️https://t.co/0aOmAADPdG  #SaveKoreanDogs from #SouthKoreaWildfire"

Mentally I was a disaster, working a dead end job & fighting like hell to see my son more than 6 days a month.  There were MANY days I wanted to end it all.  Yes.  It’s difficult transitioning from a boy into a man.  Especially as a “younger” father.  As a kid & teenager I always knew I would go onto do meaningful things… but when the years pass by & the opportunities seem to be nearing an end rather than a beginning… this becomes tough to deal with.  I can’t tell you exactly what drew me to crypto.  Perhaps it was hearing people were making insane money & I was struggling to get 2 Pennies to rub together…. But I needed money in a bad way to help pay for attorneys fees during my custody battle & to also keep my piece of shit car on the road so I could drive 1.5h to work every day each direction.  I entered this space as a NOBODY.  A 0 follower Randy.  After a few months of studying & seeing some really small wins, I felt I was on the correct path.  Looking back on everything & seeing how much has been accomplished.  Escaping credit card debt, purchasing my first home, buying my second new vehicle, leaving my job to pursue a career in this full time, buying a new camper, constantly traveling and finally enjoying my life.  I really can’t help but just be so thankful.  Genuinely.  As someone who has always taken the riskier side of things (motocross broke me lol) I’m just so GD grateful that I took this chance on myself.  Even more so when I truly began to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Don’t get it twisted, I saw MANY bad times throughout this journey.  From round tripping 7 figures, selling the biggest meme of our time before it ran 10,000x & being rugged multiple times… I still don’t give a fuck.  I made it.  Like, I really made it.  I’m not retired, I’ve gotta get my mom their first & finish paying off her student loan debt.  But I really feel like I’ve made it & did it all without it being at the expense of someone else’s misfortunes… which happens all too often in this space.  Majority of my time these days is doing my best to work on myself and be around for my son.   The rest of it?  It’s spent with you guys.  I don’t have much of a social life.  I have nothing in common with majority of people I meet.  At the end of the day, I wouldn’t trade it for anything.  To those of you that support me here.  Thank You 💙  I would not be where I am without you all.  - Daddi"

Analysts from Wedbush Securities analysts called the quarterly report a ""disaster on every metric"" and a ""fork in the road moment"" for Musk.  America is turning hard on Trump's right-hand man...  Tesla sales dropped by roughly 13% in the first months of this year as backlash grew against Musk for his use of DOGE to gut our federal government as well as his plans to destroy Social Security.  His flagship company reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries from January to March, down from the 387,000 that they delivered in the same window last year.   The total came in far lower than the 408,000 deliveries that were predicted by analysts. Overall, Tesla's stock is down close to 50% since late December.  Clearly, the backlash is far more potent than anyone expected. As it turns out, Americans don't take kindly to selfish billionaires systematically destroying their lives.  ""The more political he gets with DOGE the more the brand suffers, there is no debate. This quarter was an example of the damage Musk is causing Tesla,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote.

I’ve been lucky to meet many ultra-successful people in my life. Everyone from Tony Robbins to Gary Vee.   When I worked in banking I got to meet the founders of some of the biggest companies in the world.  One thing always stuck with me: they believed there are basically zero rules. None of these people ever let rules get in the way.   They saw rules as guidelines at best. Often, if they wanted to disrupt an industry they had to disregard the rules and even create new ones.  Average people don’t do this.   They see rules as fixed roadblocks that scream “Computer says no, buddy!” Well, you can make the computer say yes to your dreams if you’re willing to.  Rules are often set by gatekeepers who want to keep the power and control for themselves.   My favorite part about living in these modern times is the internet keeps giving the middle finger to the rules.  Just a few months ago banks were still trying to block Bitcoin. In the last few months we’ve gone parabolic. The internet said “F*ck traditional money” and society has finally accepted it.  Whether you’re a crypto bro or not doesn’t matter.

And talking to strangers is as uncomfortable as it gets.  I’ve been studying Timothy Leary lately. He’s most famous for his thoughts on LSD.  He’s a total tripper in many ways, but gee does he have some kickass, mind-bending views (must be all the magic mushrooms). He said this:  The more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the ‘normal people’ as they go about their automatic existences.  This hit me hard. I’ve never fit in. I’ve always been a weirdo.  In society Timothy says we have club passwords like ‘Have a nice day’ and ‘Weather’s awful today, eh?’ But we’re dying to say forbidden things such as ‘Tell me something that makes you cry’ or ‘What do you think deja vu is for?’  I often think to myself when I meet a stranger, “Yeah but why do what you do?!”  Timothy says if you want to escape the hell of average, you must take more chances on having conversations with strangers.  Everybody carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others.  Inside the minds of strangers is the wisdom you could never figure out on your own. Stop drowning in loneliness and frustration and reach out to a new person every day for the next 6 months.

It’s why I say crazy statements in front of local government such as “But what if they’re pedos?” or “Could they be a charity pretending to do good while quietly doing evil?”  I get all sorts of crazy stares when I say the quiet parts out loud.

They can’t stomach taking any risk at all. They focus on the downsides, the risks, and the failure they feel is a guarantee.  But if you don’t take risks all you end up with are regrets that rot your mind slowly over time. It’s mental torture if you let it happen.  I prefer to take calculated risks. I do my research. I expect failure to happen. And when it does, I figure out why so I can learn from it.  I also learn from other people’s failures so I don’t have to make the same mistakes.  Right now, write down all of the risks you took in the last 12 months. If you end up with a blank page then you’re in the fast lane for mediocrity.  The good news is you can escape.

A lack of will is often covered up with perfectionism, complexity, overthinking, seeking out endless free mentors, or even believing you need more resources (money).  “Will” is emotional intelligence. “Skill” is intellectual intelligence.  As we move out of the over information age, intelligence and skill acquisition are becoming less relevant. What you need is the will.  The will to be bold. The will to help others. The will to make a change. The will to reprogram your mind. The will to push yourself beyond your comfort zone.

While such measures are often sold as ""America First"" strategies, their economic consequences extend far beyond U.S. borders, sending shockwaves through global trade, inflation, employment, and entire industries.  The Ripple Effect: How Tariffs Disrupt Global Trade  Tariffs act as a tax on imported goods, making them more expensive for consumers and businesses alike. When Trump raises tariffs, he is effectively forcing companies to either absorb higher costs or pass them on to consumers, leading to inflationary pressures.  Key sectors such as technology, automotive, and agriculture are among the hardest hit. For instance, tariffs on Chinese electronics will directly impact American manufacturers relying on affordable components. In the auto industry, increased costs on steel and aluminum imports make vehicle production more expensive, ultimately leading to higher car prices for consumers. Meanwhile, retaliatory tariffs from affected countries will harm U.S. farmers, who depend on exports to sustain their livelihoods.  A Dangerous Game: The Unemployment Domino Effect  Protectionist measures, while seemingly designed to ""protect American jobs,"" often have the opposite effect. Higher costs for businesses mean budget cuts, reduced hiring, and layoffs. The trade war between the U.S. and China during Trump's first presidency resulted in American manufacturing job losses rather than the promised boom. This cycle is likely to repeat, disproportionately affecting small businesses that lack the financial flexibility to absorb these increased costs.  A Self-Inflicted Economic Wound  The idea that tariffs strengthen a nation’s economy is a common misconception. Historically, tariffs have led to economic downturns, with the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 exacerbating the Great Depression. Today, as global economies struggle with post-pandemic recovery, another wave of trade barriers could push fragile markets into recession.  Furthermore, tariffs on essential goods lead to price surges that disproportionately affect middle- and lower-income citizens. While large corporations may navigate these barriers through price adjustments, average consumers bear the brunt of increased living costs.  Global Trade Alliances: A Shift Away from the U.S.  One of the biggest long-term risks of Trump’s tariff policies is the potential alienation of trade partners. Countries affected by U.S. tariffs are likely to seek alternative trade alliances, reducing dependence on American markets. The European Union, China, and emerging economies may accelerate efforts to establish trade agreements that circumvent the United States, ultimately weakening its global economic influence.  A Warning for the Future  If these tariff policies persist, we can expect a world where prices continue to rise, unemployment becomes a growing concern, and international relations deteriorate. Tariff wars do not create prosperity; they create economic fragmentation, uncertainty, and stagnation. A truly prosperous economy is built on cooperation, not isolation.  It is crucial for investors, policymakers, and everyday citizens to recognize the dangers of reckless protectionism. Instead of imposing blanket tariffs, strategic economic policies should focus on innovation, sustainable domestic production, and competitive global participation.  The world economy does not thrive in silos. The sooner we acknowledge this, the better positioned we will be to create lasting economic growth and stability."

This so-called urologist from Bunbury isn’t just a bumbling fool with a medical degree, she’s an Australophobe hellbent on selling out her own country to the globalist elite, and the stench of her New World Order (NWO) agenda is so thick you’d need a hazmat suit to stand near her.   Her recent leap into politics as an “Independent” candidate for Forrest? A sham so transparent it’s laughable except it’s not funny when you realize this dimwit’s been groomed to dismantle Australia’s soul with the precision of a drunk butcher.  Her career pivot screams Young Global Leaders (YGL)—that World Economic Forum petri dish of brainwashed stooges like Jacinda Ardern and Justin Trudeau. Don’t be shocked if Chapman’s name’s etched on some secret YGL roster, her Madagascar “humanitarian” jaunts a resume booster for Klaus Schwab’s protege program.  Those trips with Australian Doctors for Africa? Not charity, it was training grounds for an Australophobic traitor learning how to sterilize populations while pretending to care. She’s spent years perfecting her cuts on prostates; now she’s aiming to neuter Australia’s spirit, and her YGL connections are the smoking gun.   Hand-picked by the Davos crowd, she’s a sleeper cell activated to turn Forrest into a testing ground for their dystopian fantasies. Her platform’s a steaming pile of NWO drivel only a retard could take seriously. “Healthcare for all”? That’s her YGL script talking—mandatory jabs, digital IDs, and a social credit system to choke out anyone who dares resist.   Her “Housing solutions” are code for confiscating land from honest Aussies and cramming them into 15-minute prison cities, all while she sneers at rural life like the Australophobe she is and the “sustainable development” agenda is straight from the Agenda 2030 playbook, depopulation, bug diets, and climate lies she’s too stupid to question, parroting her WEF masters like a brain-dead puppet.   She hates Australia, hates its rugged independence, its wide-open spaces, its people, and she’s itching to pave it over with globalist concrete.  That Christchurch Medal from USANZ is a participation trophy for a useful idiot, handed out by the same establishment that’s probably got her on speed dial to Geneva. Her overseas “surgeries” weren’t aid they were NWO eugenics trials, and her urology background makes it all too convenient. Population control’s their game, and she’s the retard with the tools to play it.   Retired from medicine just in time to run for office? Yeah, right. It's more like she got the green light from her Young Global Leader handlers to step up and sell Australia down the river.  Where was this Australophobic moron when lockdowns crushed Bunbury, when kids were jabbed with mystery juice, when freedom was torched? Probably clapping like a trained seal, too dumb to see the tyranny or too complicit to care.   W.A. has their names for her: “globalist retard,” “YGL plant,” “Aussie-hating WEF stooge.”  A couple of reports ties her to Big Pharma cash funneled through her medical past; another claims her Madagascar gigs were Soros-funded, with YGL fingerprints all over the paperwork. True or not, the stench is undeniable, she’s a walking talking globalist knee deep in eugenics and depopulation, but she's too stupid to hide it.  Dr. Sue Chapman isn’t just a retired urologist with a midlife crisis—she’s a retard, an Australophobe, and a Young Global Leaders’ lapdog ready to carve Australia into bite-sized pieces for the NWO feast.  Every vote for her is a vote for a microchipped, meatless, freedomless hell where she grins like an idiot while the black helicopters land.  Wake up, Forrest—this dimwitted traitor’s not just cutting prostates anymore she’s coming for your country, and she’s too brain-dead to even know why and too compromised to care"

This is largely Sri Lanka's fault as we remain one of the most protected economies in the world.   We export 6.5 times more to the US than we import from them. But the US tariffs on Sri Lanka are less than 10% and the US does not impose any additional non-tariff barriers or taxes. The United States has been good to Sri Lanka from a trade perspective.   But in return, Sri Lanka which has a massive trade surplus with the US imposes tariffs of over 80% on US imports. Not only do we impose tariffs but Sri Lanka also imposes non tariff barriers such as para tariffs and other charges which is not fair to be honest. Non tariff barriers are unethical in my view.   Many experts including myself have been raising this issue since January. At least the Sri Lankan government should have reduced the para tariffs. When Trump moves very fast almost by the hour, we cannot afford to have committees and spend months to study what action to take. This is especially when our export sector depends on the American market. Our apparel sector directly employs 300,000 people and indirectly helps over a million Sri Lanka. The consequences of this are big.  For years, I have been advocating to reduce trade barriers but successive past governments have not done this. We export $2,600 million to the US but only import $400 million from the US. We should have handled the US export market better."

Not just another overcollateralized DeFi experiment or an algorithmic disaster waiting to happen.  Unlike most stablecoins backed by treasuries or low-yielding debt, CAP is building a model backed by private strategies across TradFi, DeFi, and in-house solutions. And it’s protected by shared security models that bring a whole new layer of resilience.  Think about it. USDC and USDT are backed by traditional bonds - safe, sure, but limited. CAP’s approach is more versatile and way more ambitious. It’s using HFT firms, private equity, RWAs, DeFi protocols, and cross-domain arbitrage strategies as sources of yield. All that yield, then, flows back to the stablecoin holders.  And the most interesting part? It’s a shared security model via Eigen Layer. CAP uses restakers to provide coverage for operator activities. That means ETH holders get to earn fees in blue-chip assets by providing security to these yield-generating strategies.  The 3 key players:  1. Minters - Stablecoin holders with cUSD, redeemable 1:1 against USDC/USDT.  2. Operators - Big players (HFTs, banks, funds) generating yield through custom strategies.  3. Restakers - ETH pools providing security to operators, earning premiums for their coverage.  This is the first stablecoin protocol to outsource yield generation programmatically and with full coverage. That’s a massive edge over the competition.  What Makes CAP Special?  CAP isn’t just another “decentralized stablecoin” built on buzzwords. It’s a real attempt to bridge the gap between TradFi yield strategies and on-chain finance. And it’s doing it with smart contracts that align incentives for everyone involved.  Most importantly, it’s NOT backed by bonds, but by custom TradFi and DeFi strategies, creating yield in ways we haven’t seen before.  The stablecoin wars are coming, and CAP looks like one of the strongest and fresh contenders to break through."

Trump’s latest tariffs have wiped $2 TRILLION off the stock market in just 25 seconds, sending shockwaves through global markets.  Announcing the move in what he called ""Liberation Day"", Trump slapped massive taxes on imports from 60 countries, including China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU.  And the markets? They collapsed.  🔻 S&P 500: Down $2 trillion 🔻 Nasdaq: -3.5% 🔻 Apple: -7% 🔻 Tesla: -8% 🔻 US Dollar: 6-month low  One person on X summed it up:  ""Not to alarm anyone, but the U.S. stock market just lost over $2 trillion in 20 minutes.""  Another added:  ""Trump went bankrupt six times. America is just lucky number seven.""  European and Asian markets didn’t escape either—London, Paris, Germany, Japan, and Hong Kong all took a hit. Vietnam’s market plummeted 6.7% after getting slapped with 50% tariffs.  Meanwhile, investors are panic-buying gold, pushing it to a record $3,167.50 per ounce overnight.  A portfolio manager at Janus Henderson summed it up:  ""Markets are on edge. The real question is: how much economic pain can the U.S. take?""

Spoiler alert: because they work, for them. You’ve got nations all over the world protecting their industries, shielding their workers, and securing their national interests through tariffs, quotas, and trade barriers. Meanwhile, American politicians, mostly globalist lapdogs, tell us that we can’t do the same, or the sky will fall.  Critical thinking time:  If tariffs were universally bad, no one would use them.  If we use tariffs, it’s called “protectionism.”  If they use tariffs, it’s called “economic strategy.”  You see the game yet?  They’ve conditioned Americans to think that standing up for our own economy is selfish, while getting fleeced by countries like China is somehow noble. They call it “free trade,” but it’s never been free, it’s been rigged.  So maybe it’s time we stop listening to the same people who shipped our factories overseas, gutted our middle class, and now lecture us about ""free markets"" from their gated communities.  If 170 other countries are playing hardball, maybe we stop showing up to a knife fight with a handshake.  Tariffs aren’t anti-economy, they’re pro-America."

That is the inconvenient truth many do not want to hear. Mnangagwa’s rule has been a total disaster.  If another version of ZANUPF can do the bare minimum—healthcare, jobs, clean drinking water, fixing roads, etc.—it will get the support of ordinary people.  This is the case because there is no visible opposition on the ground that presents a real alternative, except on Twitter, where citizens only get unfulfilled promises not backed by action from various opposition politicians.  Blessed “Bombshell” Geza is popular because he has provided an alternative and backed it up with action.  He is trying to do something. He is only being attacked by those in the supposed opposition who fear that his success will render them permanently irrelevant.  We have a dishonest media that picks sides out of personal interest and a backlash from opposition-controlled ghost accounts.  That is why citizens are often unaware of the implications of certain actions.  The truth is that if a new ZANUPF leader emerges and starts delivering, they will receive support based on delivery, not emotional loyalty.  The media and Zimbabwean scholars must tell the truth and analyse honestly.  That is why scholars like Professor Miles Tendi are sought after in public discourse—they are not professors for hire who choose sides for personal or emotional reasons.  Much of Zimbabwe’s political public discourse is not taken seriously because some scholars support nonsense on both sides of the political aisle, and some media actors write for politicians instead of writing about them.  These individuals are joined by activists in social movements and NGOs who are angling for jobs in future administrations. They bootlick politicians and embarrass themselves on social media instead of being honest about the state of affairs.  So, my message to opposition leaders is, if you don’t take the bull by the horns, change will end up coming from within the ruling party.  The only thing that the next ZANUPF leader needs to do is the bare minimum, because Mugabe left the bar on the floor—and Mnangagwa took it into the basement.  The same thing applies to the opposition, Tsvangirai left a structured opposition, now there is nothing left on the ground!  What we need is candid assessments of the Zimbabwean political landscape and the current state of ZANUPF and the opposition, and looking at the potential for change within the ruling party or a hybrid union between ZANUPF and elements of the opposition.  The idea that citizens may settle for a better version of ZANUPF or a hybrid union due to a lack of viable alternatives is a sobering thought that is based on reality and not propaganda to quote Winky D’s new song.  You can’t expect change from ZANUPF to the opposition when that opposition doesn’t exist! The ideal situation is to have a proper structured opposition, but it doesn’t exist at the moment!  Anyone who comes after Mnangagwa will know that the region and the continent were disappointed by his corrupt rule and breathtaking incompetence, appointing useless ministers like Tatenda Mavetera, so they will have to do something meaningful and visible to position Zimbabwe to be an attractive destination for foreign investment again.  Strive Masiyiwa said it in Rwanda yesterday—capital goes where it feels safe, capital is a coward, and as he said, it will not announce why it is not coming, you will just see it emerge where there is order and a vision!  So it is not about whether Geza will fail or succeed, it is about why he is a political phenomenon opposing his own party when that should be the job of a traditional opposition on the ground, not on Twitter!"

Every time you open that trap of yours, you remind us of why we’re winning.    But seriously though...  WTF happened to you?  You used to be a halfway tolerable comedian, but now you’re just a Trump-obsessed pyscho who can’t let go of 2016.   Newsflash, Rosie: He won. You lost.  ✌️ times  Actually ✌️🖕 times.   Silly me.   You're mad because America picked a billionaire over your elitist Hollywood bullshit, and it’s been eating you alive ever since.   I can guar-un-fcking-tee that you, Rosie O'Donnell has screamed at the sky on multiple occasions because of this.  And we love that about you.   Keep going.   You’ve spent years crying about “muh democracy” while President Trump’s out there draining the swamp and making liberals like you shit bricks.  If only they were literal bricks, we would have that wall built faster than you can say...  Happy Cinco Deporto!  Let’s talk about your Trump Derangement Syndrome.   You’ve got it worse than anyone, sweetheart.   That man lives rent-free in that thick skull of yours, and it’s fcking hilarious.   Every tweet, every rant, every unhinged YouTube video you’ve puked out—it’s all about him.   You’re so obsessed, I’m starting to think you’ve got a secret MAGA hat stashed under your bed for late-night fantasies.   Admit it, Rosie: you hate him because he’s everything you’re not.   Successful, unapologetic, and loved by millions who don’t give a damn about your woke nonsense.  And speaking of woke...  Holy shit Clarabelle! 🐄   You’re the poster child for every liberal cliché!  You’re out there preaching about “tolerance” while trashing anyone who doesn’t kiss your ass or buys into your mental disorder bullshit.   You’ve got the balls ( I didn't mean to assume your gender) to call President Trump a dictator, but you would lock us all in gulags if you could, wouldn’t you?   You’re a hypocrite with a big mouth.   The only thing bigger than your ego is your waistline—sorry, had to go there, but damn, it’s low-hanging fruit, just like your career.  I refuse to watch one of my favorite movies of all-time because of you and Hanksy Pansky.   Yeah I'm talking about A League of Their Own.  And yes I'm talking about Tom Hanks.   That movie was an absolute classic.   But you fcked all of that up for many people.   You were great in that movie.   But then that mouth of yours opens and I want to punch myself in the balls to take away the pain of hearing your fcking voice.   You were a ""star"" at one point.   Now you’re reduced to yelling into the void on social media, hoping someone—anyone—still gives a shit.   Spoiler Alert: We don’t.   We are too busy winning to care about your sob stories or your latest meltdown.   You’re a fossil, babe, and President Trump’s the meteor that wiped you out.  Maybe if you spent less time bitching about President Trump and more time figuring out why everyone around you bails, you’d be less of a miserable btch.   But nah, that would require self-awareness, and we all know you’re allergic to that.  So here’s the deal, Rosie: Keep screaming, keep flailing, keep proving why MAGA’s the future and you’re the past.   President Trump’s still standing, America’s still thriving, and you’re still an irrelevant loudmouth with nothing to show for it.   Enjoy the sidelines—it’s where you belong.

Owned 60 $SOXL contracts this morning. Also in $SOXS as well but smaller size. Literally explaining to Steve all morning how $SOXS was in a C wave and was coming way way down. What did I do? I lost money. I sold all of the contracts for a net loss of $500 which was better than the $10K I was down yesterday. I puked instead of trusting my system. Look at the timeline on these pics. I had the setup all morning. Sat there watching it play out EXACTLY as I told Steve it would. And, instead of waiting to sell, I was so happy to have managed the trade down to a small $500 loss instead of a $10K loss.  It was literally exhausting. Those contracts went over 500-600% off my entry from yesterday by the EOD. The setup which I completely saw b4 which is why I owned so many calls - would have made up all of the losses I took last week and then some.    Literally so disappointed in myself.
