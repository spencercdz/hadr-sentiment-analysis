In Bangkok, the earthquake's impact was significant but largely contained. The most severe incident was the collapse of a 33-story office tower under construction in the Chatuchak district, resulting in at least 18 deaths and numerous injuries. This tragic event has prompted a comprehensive review of building safety standards in the city. ​  Despite this collapse, the majority of Bangkok's infrastructure withstood the seismic event effectively. The city's payment systems and businesses continued to operate normally, with the Bank of Thailand confirming uninterrupted services across financial institutions. ​  Engineering Practices Contributing to Resilience Thailand's ability to mitigate extensive damage can be attributed to several engineering and technological practices:  1️⃣ Adherence to Seismic Building Codes: In the wake of past seismic events, Thailand has implemented stricter building codes that require structures to withstand certain levels of seismic activity. These regulations have been instrumental in ensuring the structural integrity of buildings during earthquakes.​  2️⃣Regular Structural Assessments: Developers like Raimon Land Public Company Limited (RML) have conducted swift structural inspections across their developments, affirming compliance with top-tier seismic safety standards. Such proactive assessments help identify and address potential vulnerabilities before disasters occur. ​  3️⃣Public Awareness and Preparedness: Thailand has invested in public education campaigns to raise awareness about earthquake preparedness. These initiatives have equipped citizens with the knowledge to respond effectively during seismic events, reducing panic and potential injuries.​  While the overall resilience was commendable, the collapse of the high-rise under construction highlights the need for continuous evaluation and enhancement of construction practices. Experts have emphasized the importance of rigorous enforcement of building codes and the incorporation of advanced engineering techniques to further bolster structural resilience. ​  Thailand's experience during the March 2025 earthquake underscores the critical role of stringent building codes, regular structural assessments, and public preparedness in mitigating earthquake damage. By learning from recent events and continually improving its infrastructure and response strategies, Thailand can further enhance its resilience against future seismic activities."

The 7.7 magnitude tremor was felt elsewhere, including in Thailand and south-west China. More than 2,700 people have died and more than 4,500 have been injured, say the leaders of Myanmar's military government. Those figures are expected to rise. In Thailand, at least 21 people lost their lives.🏥  WHAT CAUSED THE EARTHQUAKE?  🌎   The earth's upper layer is split into different sections, called tectonic plates, which are all moving constantly. Some move alongside each other, whilst others are above and below each other. It is this movement that causes earthquakes and volcanoes. Myanmar is considered to be one of the most geologically ""active"" areas in the world because it sits on top of the convergence of four of these tectonic plates - the Eurasian plate, the Indian plate, the Sunda plate and the Burma microplate. The Himalayas were formed by the Indian plate colliding with the Eurasian plate, and the 2004 Tsunami as a result of the Indian plate moving beneath the Burma microplate. Dr Rebecca Bell, a reader in tectonics at Imperial College London, said that to accommodate all of this motion, faults - cracks in the rock - form which allow tectonic plates to ""slither"" sideways. There is a major fault called the Sagaing fault, which cuts right through Myanmar north to south and is more than 1,200km (746 miles) long. Early data suggests that the movement that caused Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake was a ""strike-slip"" - where two blocks move horizontally along each other. This aligns with the movement typical of the Sagaing fault. As the plates move past each other, they can become stuck, building friction until it is suddenly released and the earth shifts, causing an earthquake.

myanmar,1907769974703472891,2025-04-03_12-19-41,en,Human & Machine,false,151824,The Blockchain,13,118,24,"🇲🇲🇹🇭The recent 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar and Thailand on March 28, 2025, sent tremors across Southeast Asia, causing significant damage and loss of life.   In Myanmar, the death toll has surpassed 3,000, with thousands more injured and missing. Neighboring Thailand also felt the quake's impact, with Bangkok experiencing structural failures, including the collapse of a 33-story building under construction, resulting in at least 18 fatalities. ​  These events underscore the critical importance of earthquake preparedness and resilient infrastructure in seismic zones. Japan, a nation frequently affected by earthquakes, has long been recognized for its advanced seismic technology and stringent building standards, which have significantly mitigated earthquake-related damages.​  🇯🇵Japan's approach to earthquake preparedness encompasses several key strategies:​  🗾Seismic Isolation Systems: Many Japanese buildings incorporate seismic isolation bearings, allowing structures to move horizontally during an earthquake. This design reduces stress on the building, minimizing damage. ​  🗾Early Warning Systems: Japan has invested in meteorological and seismic monitoring systems that provide early warnings, enabling timely evacuations and preparations.  🗾Strict Building Codes: The country enforces rigorous building regulations that require structures to withstand significant seismic activity. This commitment to safety has resulted in approximately 87% of new buildings being capable of withstanding major quakes. ​  🗾Public Education and Drills: Regular nationwide earthquake drills and public education campaigns ensure that citizens are well-prepared to respond effectively during seismic events. ​  In 2025, Japan adopted AI-driven crisis management services that analyze real-time data from social media, weather reports, and traffic information to provide accurate insights during disasters. This technology enhances situational awareness and facilitates efficient emergency responses.  Beyond technological advancements, Japan has cultivated a culture of disaster preparedness. Regular earthquake drills are conducted nationwide, ensuring that citizens are well-versed in emergency procedures. This societal commitment to readiness plays a crucial role in minimizing casualties and damage during seismic events.  The recent earthquake affecting Myanmar and Thailand highlights the necessity for countries in seismic regions to adopt comprehensive earthquake preparedness measures.   Implementing advanced engineering practices, establishing early warning systems, enforcing strict building codes, and promoting public education can significantly reduce the impact of earthquakes.​  Japan's multifaceted approach to earthquake mitigation—encompassing cutting-edge engineering, innovative materials, advanced warning systems, AI integration, and a culture of preparedness—serves as a global benchmark for seismic resilience. These concerted efforts have significantly enhanced the nation's ability to withstand and recover from earthquake events."

Bangladesh’s exports to  Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar will be affected.  Bangladesh has invited #Chinese help in revitalising an air base Lalmonirhat, near India’s Siliguri Corridor also known as the Chicken’s Neck—India’s critical gateway to its northeastern states.  Reports suggest Bangladesh is exploring strategic cooperation with China in the region, prompting apprehensions in New Delhi about a growing Chinese footprint near a militarily sensitive zone. The cancellation would lead to higher costs and delays for Bangladeshi exporters. Approx 20-30 loaded trucks arrive in Delhi Air Cargo complex every day, which slows down the smooth movement of cargo, and airlines are taking undue advantage of this. This leads to an excessive increase in air freight rates, delay in handling and processing of export cargo, and severe congestion at the Cargo Terminal at the IGI Airport, Delhi, resulting in exports of Indian apparel exports through the Delhi air cargo complex becoming uncompetitive.
